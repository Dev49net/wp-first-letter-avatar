Set custom avatars for users with no Gravatar. The avatar will be a first (or any other) letter of the users's name, just like in Discourse.

== Description ==

WP First Letter Avatar **sets custom avatars for users without Gravatar**. The avatar will be a first letter of the users's name, just like in Discourse (<http://www.discourse.org/>). You can also configure plugin to use any other letter to set custom avatar. 

WP First Letter Avatar includes a set of **beautiful, colorful letter avatars** in many sizes. Optimal size will be chosen by the plugin in order to display high quality avatar and not download, for example, big 512px avatars when only 48px is needed... **PSD template** for avatar is also included - it's a simple Stag Sans Thin letter. 

You can also create your own avatar set by creating new directory next to *'default'* folder and following the naming convention from *'default'*. Keep in mind that your avatar set will be deleted after updating plugin!

By default, custom avatar will be set only to users without Gravatars, but you can change that in settings and not use Gravatar at all.

WP First Letter Avatar helps you **bring more colors** into your blog. Plus, your readers will be more **willing to comment on your posts**, since they can actually relate to these avatars much better than to Monsters or Mystery Man.

All images were compressed using the fantastic <https://tinypng.com/>, so avatars are **incredibly light and ultra-high quality**.

You can [fork the plugin on GitHub](https://github.com/DanielAGW/wp-first-letter-avatar).
